# If you have an ~/.ssh/config with a ControlMaster setup, all ssh connections
# to a host will be multiplexed, including bulk transfers that will increase
# the latency of interactive sessions.  This program simply calls rsync with
# -e "ssh -S none" to avoid multiplexing with other ssh sessions.
#
# This does not use exec so that bulk-rsync processes can be easily identified.
rsync -e "ssh -S none" "$@"
